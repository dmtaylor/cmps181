Summary
-------

In implementing the query engine, we were met with production difficulties and
setbacks, which made development by the final due date challenging. As of this
writing, no test cases should work. While a good amount of code exists, and
much work was done on it, we were unable to fully implement the query engine.
    
Requirements
------------

For this assignment, we needed to do two things: to retrofit the RelationManager
module to handle working with indices and to implement a query engine to execute
a query plan. The assignment specifications give some instructions for both the
former and the latter, but left some of the implementation details up to the
developers.

Design
------

In our design for integrating indices into the RelationManager module, we
decided to use a system catalog to keep track of all index files. Working very
similarly to the Tables and Columns catalogs, the Indices catalog is used to
track all existing indices. When an RM operation is made which will modify
any indices, such as an insert, the catalog is used to fetch the indices and
make the appropriate modifications. For the QE module, we followed the design
specifications in the instructions.

Implementation
--------------

We were able to implement much of the RM modifications and the QE module,
however not entirely. Implementing the indices catalog resulted in delays, and
understanding the interface design for the QE module consumed a good deal of
production time. We were able to implement all QE modules except for the
Nested-Loop-Join interface, and we implemented most of the modifications to RM.

Testing
-------

Due to the delays in production, we were unable to do any rigorous testing on
our codebase. As such, we are unsure as to the correctness of the implemented
code. We have assumed that we will receive zero points on the testing portion
of the grading.
